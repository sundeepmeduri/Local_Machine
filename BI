Notions of Business inelligence:

what BI can in general tell you ?

1. what is driving my business today ?
2. what emerging trends should I be aware of ?
3. what will happen if no one intervenes ?

make decisions like:
1. discontinue a product due to less usage or sales
2. increase production of product in more regions due to increase in demand.

--> so we use BI to prove all the above points using the data.

Gathering the business needs:
------------------------------
-- Decision making needs
-- Relevant data and information

ask clients the following:
1. What problems does the business wants to solve ?
2. does the existing product align with the growth strategy ?
3. what data is relevant to calculate the products commercial viability ?
4. where can the data be sourced from ?

Information requirements in brief:
-----------------------------------
1. statement of business operations
2. overview of the problems
3. relevent KPI's
4. Data needed

Profiling the business:
------------------------

Note: Always try to understand the business model first before looking into business problems 
-----

Business model: Describes how a business operates, generates income and manages costs.
---------------


Business profiling in short:
-----------------------------
1. what does it do ?
2. who are the customers ?
3. who is the competition ?
4. what is your clients competative differentiator ?
5. do they understand the price sensitivity ?


1. what does client think is causing the profitability problem ?
2. what does client think are the business threats ?
3. how does client percive the organisational culture and strengths ?


Reviewing the source data:
--------------------------

define your data requirements 
  -- prepare a list of required data fields.
  -- understand the structure of the data.
  -- data should be well defined and structured
  
 Data granularity:
 ------------------
 The lowest level that data can be in a target set. If we have data at highest granular level we can analyse and report 
 the data in all possible ways.
 
 for example: if we have data for each month in aggregated format that may not help well to analyse. we may need the data on a weekly
 ,daily, hourly, per minute or per second. the least level of data will help in more accurate analysis for a time series chart.
 
 Data relevance:
 ----------------
 1. Is this information relevant for solving my clients problem ?
 2. will this data provide the insights to make informed  business decisions ?
 
 Data driven insights:
 ----------------------
 what the problem is ?
 why the problem exists ?
 how to improve ?
 
 Illustrating results:
 ---------------------
 client my wants to know after seeing the results of our analysis.
 
 1. why is the number so high or low ?
 2. can you show the data that sits underneath a graph ?
 3. can you apply few filters ?
 
 
 prepare the final report:
 --------------------------
 1. business problems to solve ? (where the journey started and where the problems occured ?)
 2. restate why you are hired ? (expain about your expertise)
 3. outline the process and methodology
 4. data analysed
 5. tools used to analyse the data
 6. share insights (should tell actions to take to solve the business problems)
