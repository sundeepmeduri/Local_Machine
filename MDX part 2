Descendants: using this function we can get members of above and below level.  
------------
Descendants(member,level,desc_flags)
Descendants(member,distance,desc_flags)

distance: 1,2,3 etc level numbers

Desc_flags:
self
before
after
before_and_after
self_and_before
self_and_after
self_before_after
leaves

Note: SELF and Leaves work same way when we pass level in the argument. When we dont pass level argument the leaves will pass the least level data of the hirarchy.

Parent: using this function we can get details of parent at any level.
--------
Parent(member.parent)

if there is a hirarchy as below.

.      year
..     quarter
...    month
....   day

day.parent returns -->month
day.parent.parent returns --> quarter and so on...

Ancestor: we can pull the members of any level (above or below) by passing the member and level 
---------
Ancestor(member,Level)

Ascendants:This function will retun all the parents including the all members.
------------
Ascendants(member)

siblings:  This function will bring all the other members of member in the same level which are siblings.
----------
member.siblings

lastchild,firstchild: These functions will bring the first member or last member in the below level of current member. These functions can be used only when there are multiple hirarchies.
----------------------
(member.firstchild)
(member.lastchild)

Prevmember,nextmember,Lead,lag: These functions can be applied on member and works only for current level.
-------------------------------
member.prevmember
member.nextmember
member.lead(2)
member.lag(3)

Hierarchize: when we pull multiple members in a set in a different order than actual hierarchy then we can use the Hierarchize function show them in order.
-------------
select Hierarchize( {quarter,year,month} )
output:
  Year
  quarter
  month

Oridinal: this function will return the level number in the hierarchy.
---------
select level.ordinal on columns from cube

.    year
..   qtr
...  month

when we apply the ordinal then it will return as follows.
1,2,3


Order:
------
Order(set,Numeric expression,Asc|Desc|Break Asc|Break Desc)
